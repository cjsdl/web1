<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가</h2>
<strong>
  <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS</strong>, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
